## Description

This is a code refactor of the back-end of a fake ecommerce site that can retrieve, update, create, and delete data from a MySQL database. Made using express.js, Sequelize, MySQL2, and Insomnia as a REST client.

## Installation

Make sure MySQL is installed and working on your computer. \n Download the repository \n Edit the .env.example file to make sure the environment variables don't prevent the app from running properly.

## Usage

After installing dependencies and seeding the database, simply type `npm start` in the console to get the server running and then you will have to use a REST client(such as Insomnia or Postman) to view and utilize CRUD functionality on the database.
